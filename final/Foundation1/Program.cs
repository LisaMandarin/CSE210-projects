My BlueAir units were purchased based on the cadr ratings, and sq footage. They are supposed to do 674 sq ft rooms with 8 foot ceilings 4.8x per hour on high speed, when placed in the right space. How does Dyson‚Äôs POLAR method differ? I‚Äôd like to see some animation or explanation as to why CADR is not efficient and why POLAR works better. Something along those lines.");

A lot of people are having the same problems and what you guys do is just replace it with the new item that has the same motor design failure and yet I am still having exactly the same issues as before. The biggest problem is that the replacement does not come with a new warranty. so if your warranty is done you are done.");
